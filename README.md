# exp-framework

This repository offers a basic development framework for running cma-es experiments, a basis for morphological experiments, and an SNN implementation.

## CMA-ES-Integration

The current experimental framework, integrated with CMA-ES. [Link](https://github.com/Union-College-Computer-Science/exp_framework/tree/main/cmaes_integration)

## CMA-ES Demo

A simple cma-es demo and potential experimental framework. [Link](https://github.com/Union-College-Computer-Science/exp_framework/tree/main/cmaes_demo)

## Morphology

A series of morpological experiments, complete with graphing. [Link](https://github.com/Union-College-Computer-Science/exp_framework/tree/main/morpho_demo)

## SNN

A spike neural network (SNN) implementation in python. [Link](https://github.com/Union-College-Computer-Science/exp_framework/tree/main/snn)
